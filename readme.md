# Mini Kanban Code Challenge

Develop "Mini Trello/Kanban" interface - With Drag & Drop of cards between columns, Basic Add / Remove / Update Card

Frontend: React / Hooks + Tailwind css (or equivalent) / Apollo Client GraphQL (no redux preferably)
Backend: Python / Graphene
DB: DynamoDB Local

Notes:
- The Trello/Kanban like interface must be implemented from scratch not re-using a fully featured Kanban board package. However the drag and drop functionality can leverage a react library
- The stack is pretty much what our production stack is - so that gives an idea of our production stack

Bonus: Package / Run App in Docker container and/or AWS

Step 1:
- Delivery of Code on Github
- Record and send short 10m Loom video to demo the UI/functionality, code overview (show browser network tab with graphql queries/mutations)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
